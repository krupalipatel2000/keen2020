            Used in conjunction with other forms of shipping, like marine, rail and ground, air freight became widely utilized as one of the central delivery options 
            in importing and exporting at the beginning of the Twentieth Century. Growing exponentially as an industry during the expansion of trade networks and 
            markets in the last 40 years, air freight is now regarded as an efficient means to ship nationally and internationally.

            The express shipping options of air freight make it a valuable option for coordinating time sensitive shipments to almost anywhere in the world. 
            This can be particularly advantageous for smaller and mid-sized companies as it allows them to participate in international trade in an expeditious 
            and effective manner. Shipping by air also offers the advantage of a high level of security as airport controls over cargo are tightly managed.
